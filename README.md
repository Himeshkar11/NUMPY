# 📘 NumPy for Mathematics in AI & ML

This repository is a **step-by-step learning guide for NumPy**, focused on the **mathematics required for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**.

It is created for:
- Beginners in AI/ML
- Engineering students
- Anyone who wants to understand **math using NumPy instead of pure theory**

---

## 🚀 Why NumPy for AI & ML?

NumPy is the **foundation library** for:
- Linear Algebra
- Statistics
- Matrix operations
- Data manipulation

Almost every AI/ML library (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn) uses NumPy internally.

- Broadcasting
- Dot product

### 🔹 3. Linear Algebra (VERY IMPORTANT 🔥)
- Vectors
- Matrices
- Matrix addition & multiplication
- Transpose
- Determinant
- Inverse
- Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors

### 🔹 4. Statistics with NumPy
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Variance
- Standard deviation
- Correlation

### 🔹 5. Calculus (For ML)
- Gradients (using numerical methods)
- Partial derivatives
- Understanding loss minimization (intuition)

### 🔹 6. Random & Probability
- Random numbers
- Normal distribution
- Uniform distribution
- Sampling
- Seed concept

### 🔹 7. NumPy for Machine Learning
- Feature scaling
- Data normalization
- Vectorized operations
- Why vectorization is faster than loops
